<p>Modern Farmhouse Kitchen Makeover Black and White (With The farmhouse kitchen trend is in full swing, but rustic or french country farmhouse kitchen design doesn’t exactly blend with all homes. However, a winning palette seen in many spaces combines white, black, and natural wood tones. For instance, this dreamy kitchen built by gardner homes features white quartz countertops, black shaker cabinets, and an island wrapped in walnut wood. Most modern farmhouse kitchen cabinets are white, but any color can work when paired with the right hardware, countertops, and accessories. Employing two contrast colors of black and white, the clean and chic white cabinet catches attention over black countertops and cupboard. It has two pendant lights hanging on a wood beam ceiling and an island table with white wooden cabinets.</p>

<p>Lovely Modern Farmhouse Kitchen from Interiors By Sarah The white vein in the counter keeps the area from becoming too dark and too modern for the space. Elegant and modern styles of sinks are also coming in hot this year and will be highly sought after. With a white farmhouse sink, white kitchen walls, mullioned windows and cabinetry, the black countertops stand out and give this rustic kitchen a modern feel. My island countertop is a white granite with marbelized colors of black, grey and brown. For even more contrast, the windows are trimmed in black as well. But sometimes all it takes is cabinets and a few plants to send the modern look home.</p>
