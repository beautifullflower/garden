<p>Projects Ian Barker Gardens Landscaper Designers At zato japanese landscapes we design and construct your garden in a truly japanese spirit, the way nature intended. You might prefer a dry garden with only rocks and gravel, a courtyard with a japanese maple and a stone lantern, or a large stroll garden with a pond or lake with fish, streams and waterfalls, a bridge, maples and bamboo, and stepping stone paths. My first japanese garden picture is a photo of the garden was in 2003 with a very agressive wisteria on an old pagola and some very tame sulpher creasted cockatoos that the children feed.the wisteria was very nice when flowering with pendulus purple flowers. Karesansui , zen or dry rock gardens simple, modern and architectural, originally used to define sacred spaces, modern karesansui or zen gardens are familiar to all. Visit us and find numerous japanese lanterns and water features at rock&amp;stone. When selecting and arranging these elements in your space, it�s important to keep in mind the main design principles of a japanese garden, which include asymmetry, enclosure, borrowed scenery, balance and symbolism.</p>
