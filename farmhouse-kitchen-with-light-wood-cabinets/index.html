<p>Pin by Acidalia Decor on Kitchen Ideas in 2019 Paint for The farmhouse kitchen trend is in full swing, but rustic or french country farmhouse kitchen design doesn’t exactly blend with all homes. Combine white shiplap and light wood for an airy warmth that doesn’t feel too stark. The lines of these doors are flat and straight, lending to a versatile look that will match any paint, stain, or hardware. Paired with black knobs and pulls, these cabinets have the appeal of a classic 1950’s country kitchen. I love that they were not afraid to use a color other than white to make this gorgeous kitchen stand out. It lets the farm sink shine for sure.</p>
