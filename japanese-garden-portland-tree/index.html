<p>Japanese Maple Tree by Waterfall in Autumn, Portland I first learned about the portland japanese garden’s famous japanese maple tree from seeing a large fine art print of “tree of life” for sale in one of peter lik’s galleries. Widely regarded as one of the more authentic japanese gardens outside of japan itself, the portland japanese garden covers 5.5 acres in the city�s west hills. Any time of year is a good time to visit the portland japanese garden. The plated black bark next to the deep green twisted needles creates a noticeable presence in the garden.
