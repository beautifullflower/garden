<p>Rustic Farmhouse Table With Benches with Dark Walnut Top I must be working her too hard. So i edited the plans a bit to make two straight bases with a stretcher, and used some posts around planked 1×12’s for a beautiful, solid table. This table has been built tens of thousands of times and is loved the world over for it�s basic material composition, simple clean lines, easy to build steps, and sturdy, functional size. A farmhouse style bench can be used inside or outside on the porch. I can just envision my little family around the table, bench seating on one side, some greenery in the center, eating a great meal together (most likely just pizza though, let’s be real). It looks great and can be used in just about any room.</p>
