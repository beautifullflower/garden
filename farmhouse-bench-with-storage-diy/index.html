And lastly, this diy farmhouse bench can double as extra seating in an entry way or long hallway. It’s huge, sturdy, and i love the farmhouse style and the extra storage it provides. There is plenty of space in this coat rack to add decorative accents as well. Here�s a quick list of supplies.</p>

<p>rustic farmhouse entryway decorating ideas Mud room After adding board and batten to our entryway last year, i knew i wanted to complete the look with a farmhouse style bench for our guests! Its size is 76 inches long, which is ideal to seat four people. The french farmhouse coat rack and bench is another option for entryway storage. The hardest part is deciding what color you want to paint it. This wood bench seat is easy to build but it features a neat design. It’s perfect for your entryway, under a window, or you can even alter the plans to make it longer and use at your dining table!</p>

<p>Rustic Farmhouse Bench See this Instagram photo by Both diy benches capture perfectly the farmhouse style we love so much: You are sure to receive plenty of compliments from this coat rack and bench. The t&amp;g is 3/4″ thick, so the ledge should be glued and nailed 3/4″ down from the top. The front porch sign has a beautiful stenciled design using a stencil and paint from fusion paints and i thought the space on the deck underneath the sign was just screaming for a bench with that same stenciled design on it. Don’t you love the distressed paint finish on the first wood bench and the combination of white and rich colored wood on the other bench? This diy is a bit more involved than the farmhouse picnic table i shared a few months ago.</p>
