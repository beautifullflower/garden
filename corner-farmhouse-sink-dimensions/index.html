This depth is standard for all base cabinets. I want a traditional farmhouse sink as a corner sink. They can be fireclay (like this one we have), porcelain, stainless steel, or other fun metals. This added space will accommodate the sink and provide the additional room for plumbing.</p>

<p>Pin by Oakley Home Builders on Kitchen Designs Corner From classic style to modern you’ll discover elegant design and exquisite craftsmanship without compromise. White farmhouse sinks tend to lead the pack in popularity, but give you some variety in material. A farmhouse sink is technically called an apron front sink. Farmhouse kitchen sinks come in a variety of finishes and materials to help accentuate your style and complete the desired aesthetic for your unique kitchen. The drain will preferably be either in the middle or one corner, but either way the bottom of the sink should slope inwards around the drain so that the water easily pours down and doesn’t linger at the bottom, growing mildew. Luxury farmhouse, double bowl, flat front kitchen sink combines the classic farmhouse look with sharp lines and a modern touch.</p>
