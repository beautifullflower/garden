Warm up bright white cabinets with a rustic finish. White kitchen cabinets combined with rustic wood elements are tantamount to the farmhouse kitchen style. A magnificent modern farmhouse style open kitchen design. Even if you prefer more colorful kitchen designs, white is still an essential characteristic of farmhouse style.
