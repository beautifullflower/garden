<p>Glamping Tents Garden Village Bled Slovenia Tent Hi wayne, thank you, wayne, for taking the time to review. “we have had numerous consultations with mr hawkins and his team throughout this process. You can enter the garden at anytime and last entry into the garden is 3.00pm. However, it’s quite a long way to drive as you need to leave the town as if you are driving to the wombeyan caves and then double back towards oberon. I first saw greater mayfield in 2010 and wasn’t that keen but thought it just needed maturation time. Mayfield garden is actually opened 363 days a year, 16 hectares of the garden to explore.</p>
