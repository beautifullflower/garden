<p>8 Beautiful Rustic Country Farmhouse Decor Ideas Rustic This will work especially well in kitchens with white cabinets and walls because the baskets will pop without taking away from the airy feel.

A modern approach to this favorite style creates a clean and updated touch. The traditional farmhouse cabinets surround an oversized kitchen island complete with a meal prep area and second sink.</p>

<p>Cool 90 Rustic Kitchen Farmhouse Style Ideas I love the wire basket with paper towels, and farmhouse scale on top of the fridge! There are high quality wood, fiber and various modular designs available. We have modern, rustic, country, and shabby chic farmhouse kitchen decor. Farmhouse kitchen cabinets with open shelving. I especially love the unique farmhouse decor idea above the island and rustic touch to the kitchen hood. A rustic farmhouse kitchen in bozeman, montana features caesarstone raw concrete countertops, while the island is reclaimed oak with a clear sealer.</p>
