This should be the exact inside diameter of your garden hose. Can i put a tapered pipe thread into a straight thread like npt? Request the threads required for fire hose connections in that area consistent with your requirements. But, to actually determine the size of a pipe, the outside diameter of each pipe or fitting must be measured and compared to the table for size identification. The &gt; outside diameter of the inlet is 1 1/4.</p>
