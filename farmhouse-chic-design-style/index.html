<p>Farmhouse living room!! Chippy doors and windows. Fixer The “shabby chic” style first appeared in the british 1980s in country house décor in order to revive old furniture again. At this point, perhaps, it’s still difficult to imagine how a farmhouse decor is. It should be clean, stylish and warmhearted. We can just picture reclaimed (or original!) wood floors and a smattering of antiques. Fabulously rustic wood beams and a smattering of sunlight — perfect for getting plenty of work done in a perfectly farmhouse office. Giving outdoor elements, such as barn doors or wicker furniture, a new refined finish is common for this look.</p>
