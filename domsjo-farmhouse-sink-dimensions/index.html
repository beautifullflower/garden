No matter the research i was doing or trying to figure out my cabinet situation i was just having no luck. 🙂 more white farmhouse sinks that caught my eye. This sink sits on top of counters (not on top of cabinet). Very nice sink was over £200 new. Needs a scrub to make it shine but as is in a clean condition.</p>

<p>Our French Kitchen Renovations and Reveal Ikea farm sink It holds a ton of dishes, it’s the perfect depth for me not to be constantly bending over, it holds large pots, and the double bowl makes it easy to have a “clean side” and a “dirty side” when i’m washing pots and pans. As a result if you buy a domsjo double sink from ebay there�s a pretty good chance it will be old stock and won�t fit your domsjo base unit. A farmhouse sink breaks the tradition of hiding the bowl by highlighting the beauty of its shape and color. If you are having trouble finding details on the ikea domsjo sink, see my earlier post with part numbers and installation details. Ikea’s domsjö farmhouse sink comes in single bowl and double bowl options. And yes, the washboard is a pain to clean!!!</p>
