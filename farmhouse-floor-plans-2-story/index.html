<p>The Magnolia Blossom Farmhouse Plan (With images) Simple A farmhouse style home can call to mind a simpler way of life, with a porch for outdoor living, a large kitchen and a second story with a pitched roof and gables. The main floor also features a large great room and breakfast area that leads to an open kitchen. Classic plans typically include a welcoming front porch or wraparound porch, dormer windows on the second floor, shutters, a gable roof, and simple lines, but each farmhouse design differs greatly from one home to another. Some of the older farmhouses have a more traditional layout instead of an open floor plan. Do you remember visiting a farm and admiring the traditional home with wood siding and a front porch?
