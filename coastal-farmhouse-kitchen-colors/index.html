<p>Pin by Reina Boyson on kitchens Coastal farmhouse Designers’ favorite coastal paint colors for beach houses. Feature image via eye for style on wayfair The fern plant in the basket on the floor adds a pop of greenery. The best (modern) farmhouse paint colors. I have white paint throughout my home, and almost two years later, i’m as happy as ever. Decor in a coastal kitchen is often seaside themed.</p>

<p>Our Beach House Kitchen The Reveal Beach house kitchens I was kinda going for a coastal farmhouse vibe with my color choices and choice of materials and accessories. The overall aesthetic is bright, open, airy and casual. And into the kitchen—is pale powder from farrow and ball. My little photography assistant helping me take some after photos :) this glorious apron front farmhouse sink is one of my favorite parts of the kitchen!! This kitchen with the distressed benches just needs the curtains and the decor on the countertops and walls changed to. While i really love the farmhouse style (heck, i grew up in a 100+ year old farmhouse!) a piece of my heart will always belong to the beach.</p>
