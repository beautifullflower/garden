<p>Pin on HOME Kitchens. I am in the process of having my kitchen redone. The cabinets are made with a traditional farmhouse structure in mind, but their painted grey cabinets, white stone countertops, and subway tile backsplash keep the look fresh. You get perfect cabinet if you combine the black panel with white painted cabinets. Simple lines, cool neutrals with dramatic contrasting details, and reclaimed wood are defining elements of this look. The lines of these doors are flat and straight, lending to a versatile look that will match any paint, stain, or hardware. Above, the white open shelving is set off by a barely there blue paint color on the walls.</p>
