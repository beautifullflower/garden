Let’s look at what causes black spots on rose bush leaves and steps for treating black spot roses. If black spot is an annual problem, try a dormant spray of lime sulfur at the end of the season and again in early summer. The black spot fungus, if left untreated, can totally defoliate a rose bush, causing a weakening of the overall rose bush, thus high stress on the plant. Genetic testing is available for apc, the gene known to cause gardner syndrome. The most common form of sporotrichosis is cutaneous infection.</p>
