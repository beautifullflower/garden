<p>My 4 Misters &amp; Their Sister DIY Handmade Farmhouse Table Five 2×2 s at 40 inches in length (shelf braces); Diy modern farmhouse bench | west elm inspired a few weeks back (when i was struggling with exactly what i wanted to do and how i wanted to do it in what became our modern farmhouse dining room makeover) i was trying to decide whether i wanted to go with chairs on both sides of our farm table or whether i wanted a bench. Because of the length, the side rails are 1 x 6 to support any weight in the middle — plus the height of the rails is 1/3 of the overall height of the bench making for visually pleasing proportions. And, since benches are this month’s farmhouse hens blogger topic, it was the perfect chance to give this build a spotlight. Its size is 76 inches long, which is ideal to seat four people. The bench top (the seat) and legs are made from 1 x 12 poplar.</p>
